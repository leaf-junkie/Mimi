# Mimi
An app that allows users with parents in assisted living to connect and visit each other's parents.

The intended user does not live near their parent(s), meaning that regular visits are time consuming and difficult to maintain. Mimi allows users with parent(s) in different cities to connect and befriend each others parents.
