# Mimi
An app that allows users with parents in assisted living to connect and visit each other's parents.

The intended user does not live near their parent(s), meaning that regular visits are time consuming and difficult to maintain. Mimi allows users to connect with someone living in the same city as the user's parents. The two users essentially swap parents to visit, promoting the formation of trust and meaningful friendships for both parties.
